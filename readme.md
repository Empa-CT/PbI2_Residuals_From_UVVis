# Predicting PbI<sub>2</sub> residuals from UV-Vis spectra

This repository contains all code and data used to train the ML model presented in the publication [Advancing High-Throughput Combinatorial Aging Studies of Hybrid Perovskite Thin-Films via Precise Automated Characterization Methods and Machine Learning Assisted Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14497).

Please open "ML_UVVis.ipynb" to access the Jupyter Notebook in which the code is implemented. The file "environment.yml" includes all dependencies necessary to write the notebook within a conda environemnt.
